•	It should accept the number of the items of each dish and find the total number of dishes ordered.
•	To compute the total bill including the service tax and the GST.


Objectives of Defined Problem statement:

o	In Python, we can create a restaurant billing program for representing calculating the total bill for an order. Tkinter module is used to create the GUI application in python. Along with this, the grid module is used to create the layout of the application.
o	The program works as follow:
o	The GUI will be displayed on the screen with 8 text labels, 8 text fields and 4 buttons.
